# Python-Template-for-ML
This is a Python template for a machine learning project with tabular data which includes most common data manipulation steps as well as data profiling and visualiztion, dimension reduction and eventually modeling with hyperparameter tunning using sklearn pipeline. At the end we also use auto-sklearn package for an autoML process.
